# Novel_Network-based-model_dev (Only partial code here, since paper is recently submitted)

## Aim:
To integrate different types of networks (data), so that a more comprehensive picture will be obtained for the understanding of genetic mechanisms and the creation of new drugs.

## How to reach:
Customizing Belief Propagation algorithm and Topological Overlap Computing algorithm. Well preprocessing data. Deeply understand multi-omics networks.  

For example, here is how to customize Belief Propagation algorithm.

## Descriptions:
1. I created different novel network-based algorithms based on Belief Propagation, topological overlap computing, etc. to merge different types/units of networks. Networks can be genetic data, cyber security data, clinical data, etc.

2. TCGA data operations for downloading tomour genomic and genetic data.

## Result:
Workflow of Network-based model for multi-omics integration
